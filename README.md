# Hello-World
Assignment 1.1: Ready, Set, Hello World!
Description:
You will be building your first C++ program using a text editor and cl.exe. It will be your own version of "Hello World," but with a custom message. This will include:

Writing and creating your own hello.cpp. You can get creative with the filename, but it has to end with .cpp
Compiling said .cpp file with cl.exe
Running your .exe created by the compiler
For this first assignment, we will not be using Visual Studio's editor. You'll have to use a text editor like notepad.exe to write the C++ code. Microsoft Word will not work for this. Remember to save often.

After the code is written, there is still more work to do. You need to verify that your program compiles and runs. This means you'll have to use cl.exe to compile it. Then run it to verify expected output. At this point, the assignment is ready for submission. If you run into errors with cl.exe, follow the line number and description for a hint as how to fix it. Most common mistakes include:

Missing semicolons
Missing closed or open curly braces
C++ is case sensitive. (Main is not the same as main.)
Purpose
Explore the basic anatomy of a C++ program. Get first-hand experience with a compiler and running a program.

Tools
A PC computer or laptop
Microsoft Windows
Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition
cl.exe
Text Editor (recommend notepad.exe)
